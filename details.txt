# Byte Coder: The Agentic AI for VS Code

**Byte Coder** transforms VS Code into an autonomous development environment. It doesn't just autocomplete; it plans, architects, and builds.

## 🌟 Version 1.0.0 Release Notes

We are proud to announce the **first official release** of Byte Coder!

### 🚀 Major Features
- **9-Step Agent Pipeline**: Every request goes through a senior-level review process (Prompt Enhancement -> Planning -> Verification -> Safety Check -> Execution).
- **Shadow VCS (Time Travel)**: Safely undo *any* agent action. Reset chats to revert your project to a specific point in time.
- **Safety Evaluator**: Built-in guardrails prevent destructive commands (`rm -rf`) and accidental data loss.
- **Full Access**: The agent can read, write, edit, and execute terminal commands across your entire workspace.

### 🧠 Intelligent Workflow
1.  **Consultant Mode**: The agent plans first.
2.  **Implementation Plan**: Review the `implementation_plan.md` before coding starts.
3.  **Execution**: Watch the agent build files and run commands.

### 🔒 Privacy & Security
- Your code is processed securely and never trained on.
- All potentially dangerous actions require your confirmation.
- Hidden `.byteai` folder keeps your workspace clean.
